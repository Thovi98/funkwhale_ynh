# Funkwhale
A modern, convivial and free music server on YunoHost

[![Integration level](https://dash.yunohost.org/integration/funkwhale.svg)](https://dash.yunohost.org/appci/app/funkwhale)  
[![Install Funkwhale with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=funkwhale)

Installation requires a dedicated domain for now. I hope subpath installation will be possible in the future.

**Shipped version:** 0.18.2 (this is an Alpha version!)

## Admin

The admin uses the login you provided at installation. The password is the same you use for YunoHost.

The admin interface is accessible with the address: your.domain.fr/api/admin
